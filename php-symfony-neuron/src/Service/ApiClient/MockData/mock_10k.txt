Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview
The following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Key Performance Indicators

- Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue
- Operating income
- Net income
- Earnings per share
- Free cash flow

Results of Operations

Revenue
Total revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $8.2 billion, representing a 15% increase compared to $7.1 billion in fiscal year 2023. This growth was primarily driven by a 20% increase in our Software Solutions segment and a 12% increase in our Hardware Devices segment.

Software Solutions revenue increased to $4.5 billion from $3.75 billion in the prior year, driven by strong demand for our cloud services and new enterprise software offerings. Hardware Devices revenue grew to $3.1 billion from $2.8 billion, primarily due to the successful launch of our next-generation consumer product line. Professional Services revenue increased to $600 million from $550 million, reflecting expanded service offerings and growing demand for implementation services.

Gross Margin
Gross margin increased to 56% in fiscal year 2024 from 54% in fiscal year 2023. This improvement was primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix toward higher-margin software and services, as well as manufacturing efficiency improvements.

Operating Expenses
Operating expenses were $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, compared to $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2023. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses decreased to 39% from 40% in the prior year, reflecting our focus on operational efficiency while continuing to invest in growth initiatives.

Research and development expenses increased to $1.2 billion from $1.0 billion, reflecting our continued investment in innovation. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion to support new product launches and geographic expansion. General and administrative expenses increased moderately to $600 million from $550 million.

Operating Income
Operating income increased 25% to $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2024 from $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2023. Operating margin expanded to 17% from 15% in the prior year, driven by higher gross margins and improved operating leverage.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $3.2 billion, compared to $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2023. We generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations during fiscal year 2024, compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2023.

Capital expenditures were $350 million in fiscal year 2024, primarily related to investments in our technology infrastructure, manufacturing facilities, and retail locations. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $400 million in fiscal year 2025 to support our growth initiatives.
