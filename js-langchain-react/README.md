![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ready-darkgreen) ![Github Action CI Workflow Status](https://github.com/cf-toolsuite/tanzu-genai-showcase/actions/workflows/js-langchain-react.yml/badge.svg)

## What is it?

This application is a news aggregation tool built with React and LangChain that can be deployed to Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry and integrate with LLM services through the GenAI tile. It allows users to search for news on any topic, retrieves recent articles with source links, and generates concise 25-word summaries using an LLM.

## Architecture

View the [detailed architecture documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a comprehensive explanation of the application components and how they interact.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and npm
- Cloud Foundry CLI
- Access to Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry with GenAI tile installed
- News API key (for development)

## How to Build

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cf-toolsuite/tanzu-genai-showcase
   cd tanzu-genai-showcase/js-langchain-react
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

This creates optimized production files in the `build` directory.

## How to Run Locally

Check the [development guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## How to Run on Cloud Foundry

Check the [deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface
- **Express**: Backend API server that processes requests
- **LangChain.js**: Framework for orchestrating LLM interactions
- **News API**: External API for fetching recent news articles
- **GenAI LLM Service**: Large language model service provided by Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry
