A .NET 9 Blazor application showcasing the integration of LLMs with the Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry. This application recommends transportation options based on origin, destination, and user preferences.

## Features

- Natural language processing for travel queries
- Integration with Google Maps API for real travel data
- AI-powered analysis and recommendations
- Interactive UI with follow-up question capability
- Deployed as a Cloud Foundry application utilizing Tanzu GenAI services

## Tech Stack

- **.NET 9**: The latest version of the .NET framework
- **Blazor Server**: For interactive web UI
- **Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft's framework for LLM integration
- **Steeltoe**: Libraries for Cloud Foundry integration
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for modern UI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK
- Google Maps API key
- Access to an LLM service compatible with the OpenAI API format
- (Optional) Access to Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry with GenAI tile

### Quick Start
